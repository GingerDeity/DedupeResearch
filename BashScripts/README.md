# Bash Scripts
This is a directory filled with a variety of incredibly helpful bash scripts. Some of these commands are used so often, I typically include them in my environment's `.bashrc`. All of these can be executed with the `bash` command, and categories are listed below.

## Utilities

### cls
Run with `bash cls.sh`

A simple utility function that clears the screen, prints out a header, and lists the contents of your current directory. This version was used for when I was doing work in the Heap6 server, though it is especially helpful when you are observing multiple VMs at a time and give each VM a distinct header! In fact, each VM I use has a header.txt file that I use for this exact purpose

### psaux
